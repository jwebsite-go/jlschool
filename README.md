# JWebsite-Go — Production-Style Microservices Project

This repository contains a **production-style microservices web application**
designed and implemented as a hands-on project.

The goal was to build a system that follows **real-world backend and DevOps
principles**, including service separation, containerization, and orchestration.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- backend/        — Backend services (Go)
- frontend/       — Frontend application
- gateway/        — API Gateway
- producer/       — Message producer service
- consumers/      — Message consumer services
- db/             — Database configuration
- Dockerfile
- docker-compose.yml
- index.html
---

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

- **Frontend** — user-facing web interface
- **API Gateway** — centralized entry point for requests
- **Backend services** — business logic and data processing
- **Producer / Consumers** — asynchronous message processing
- **Database** — persistent storage layer
- **Docker Compose** — local orchestration of all services

The system is designed to resemble a **real production environment**,
with clear service boundaries and containerized deployment.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Go (Golang)
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Microservices architecture
- REST APIs
- Asynchronous messaging concepts

## 🚀 Running the Project Locally

```bash
docker-compose up --build
All services are started locally using Docker Compose to simulate a
production-like environment.
